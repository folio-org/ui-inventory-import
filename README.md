## Overview

This is a Stripes UI modules providing an administrative interface to FOLIO's Inventory Import module by communicating with [`mod-inventory-update`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-inventory-update).

## Installation

This works as for any Stripes UI module:
* For development, clone the repository, run `yarn` to build the software, then `yarn start` to run a small Stripes bundle containing only this module.
* For production, add to a platform such as [the Harvester dev platform](https://github.com/indexdata/platform-folio-dev-new/tree/harvester), and built that platform as normal.

No special considerations apply.

* [`mod-inventory-update`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-inventory-update), the corresponding server-side module.

And the various operations documents linked from [the old `ui-harvester-admin` README file](https://github.com/indexdata/ui-harvester-admin/blob/main/README.md). Some of these are still relevant, some are not.
